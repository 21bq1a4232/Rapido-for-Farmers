# Mobile Assets

This folder contains app assets including images, icons, and splash screens.

## Required Assets

### icon.png
- App icon
- Recommended size: 1024x1024 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- For now, you can use Expo's default icon or create a custom one with a tractor logo

### splash.png
- Splash screen image
- Recommended size: 2048x2048 pixels
- Will be auto-resized by Expo

## Placeholder Assets

During development, Expo provides default assets. To add custom assets:

1. Replace `icon.png` with your app icon
2. Replace `splash.png` with your splash screen image
3. Expo will automatically generate all required sizes for Android

## Creating Custom Icons

You can use free tools like:
- Canva (for design)
- Remove.bg (for transparent backgrounds)
- TinyPNG (for compression)

For a tractor rental app, consider using:
- Green color scheme (matching COLORS.primary = '#2ECC71')
- Simple tractor icon
- Clear, readable at small sizes
